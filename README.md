# Heartbeats
BSc Final Year Project

This project was developed as my dissertation for university.

Tech Stack: Javascript, CSS, HTML.

This project was a way to allow for users to see the music that most impacts their workouts. It uses the Strava API to pull a user's workouts, and the Last.fm API to pull the music that was being listened to during their workouts.
The project also makes use of an API called theAudioDB, which was used to get details about the tracks listened to (such as genre, bpm etc).

I feel with the timespan I had with this project, I suceeded in my goal of learning how to use APIs and how to organise the fetched data so that it could be turned in to something insightful.
